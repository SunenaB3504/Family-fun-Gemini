# Setting Up Apache Web Server for Family Chronicle Site

I'll guide you through the steps to host your Family Chronicle site using Apache web server.

## Step 1: Install Apache Web Server

First, you need to install Apache HTTP Server if you haven't already:

### For Windows:
1. Download Apache for Windows from [Apache Lounge](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/)
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to `C:\Apache24`
3. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and navigate to the bin directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Apache24\bin
   ```
4. Install the service:
   ```
   httpd -k install
   ```

## Step 2: Configure Apache to Serve Your Site

### httpd.conf

# DocumentRoot - change this to point to your Family Chronicle directory
DocumentRoot "c:/Users/Admin/Nia/Family-fun-Gemini"

<Directory "c:/Users/Admin/Nia/Family-fun-Gemini">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
